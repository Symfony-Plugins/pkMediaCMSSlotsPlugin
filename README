== Requirements ==

* pkMediaPlugin, of course
* pkContextCMSPlugin, of course
* All of their requirements.

== Installation ==

Enable the pkContextCMSSlideshow and pkContextCMSVideo modules and add
those slot types to the allowed slots in your pkContextCMS project:

    all:
      pkContextCMS:
        slot_types:
          pkContextCMSSlideshow: Slideshow
          pkContextCMSVideo: Video
          ... other custom slot types here

== Usage ==

Include a slideshow slot or add one to a multiple-slot area in your
pkContextCMS site in the usual way. Then click "Choose Media" in
the slot to browse the media plugin. Select photos by clicking on them. The
selected photos appear at the top of the page and can be dragged and
dropped into any desired order. When you return to the page, the
photos will appear as a slideshow in which the user clicks to advance
to the next image. (Yes, we plan to add a more obvious user interface
for slideshows.)

Video slots work the same way, except that you select only one
video per slot.

You can control the width and height at which images are displayed
by passing the `width` and `height` parameters when you
include the slot.

For a single slot:

    <?php pk_context_cms_slot('sidebar',
      'pkContextCMSSlideshow',
      array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true)) ?>

For an area (with options for other allowed slot types in the area as well):

    <?php pk_context_cms_area('sidebar',
      array(
        'allowed_types' => array('pkContextCMSRichText', 
          'pkContextCMSText', 
          'pkContextCMSSlideshow', 
          'pkContextCMSVideo'),
        'type_options' => array(
          'pkContextCMSSlideshow' => array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true),
          'pkContextCMSVideo' => array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true),
          'pkContextCMSText' => array('multiline' => true),
          'pkContextCMSRichText' => array('tool' => 'Sidebar')))) ?>

Note the use of the `flexHeight` option to specify that the height of a
slideshow or video should scale to maintain its aspect ratio relative to
the specified width.
