== Requirements ==

* pkMediaPlugin, of course
* pkContextCMSPlugin, of course
* All of their requirements.

== Installation ==

Enable the pkContextCMSSlideshow and pkContextCMSVideo modules, add
those slot types to the allowed slots in your pkContextCMS project,
and set the API key to be used when talking to pkMediaPlugin. 
Optionally you can also specify the site on which pkMediaPlugin
is running; if not, the current site will be used. Note that this
means that several instances of the CMS can share a single media
repository:

    all:
      pkContextCMS:
        slot_types:
          pkContextCMSSlideshow: Slideshow
          pkContextCMSVideo: Video
          ... other custom slot types here
        # Optional
        media_site: http://www.mymediasite.com
        # Required
        media_apikey: "yourapikey"

On the site where pkMediaPlugin is installed (which can be the
same site), you'll need to list the same API key:

    all:
      pkMedia:
        apikeys:
          - "yourapikey"

=== When pkMediaPlugin Is On A Separate Site ===

You don't necessarily have to run pkMediaPlugin and pkContextCMSPlugin
on the same site. A remote media repository will work just as well
as a local one. 

By default the pkMedia API will attempt to talk to pkMediaPlugin running
on the same site. You an change that like this in `app.yml`:

all:
  pkContextCMS:
    media_site: http://www.mymediasite.com


== Usage ==

Include a slideshow slot or add one to a multiple-slot area in your
pkContextCMS site in the usual way. Then click "Choose Media" in
the slot to browse the media plugin. Select photos by clicking on them. The
selected photos appear at the top of the page and can be dragged and
dropped into any desired order. When you return to the page, the
photos will appear as a slideshow in which the user clicks to advance
to the next image. (Yes, we plan to add a more obvious user interface
for slideshows.)

Video slots work the same way, except that you select only one
video per slot.

You can control the width and height at which images are displayed
by passing the `width` and `height` parameters when you
include the slot.

For a single slot:

    <?php pk_context_cms_slot('sidebar',
      'pkContextCMSSlideshow',
      array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true)) ?>

For an area (with options for other allowed slot types in the area as well):

    <?php pk_context_cms_area('sidebar',
      array(
        'allowed_types' => array('pkContextCMSRichText', 
          'pkContextCMSText', 
          'pkContextCMSSlideshow', 
          'pkContextCMSVideo'),
        'type_options' => array(
          'pkContextCMSSlideshow' => array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true),
          'pkContextCMSVideo' => array('width' => 240, 'flexHeight' => true),
          'pkContextCMSText' => array('multiline' => true),
          'pkContextCMSRichText' => array('tool' => 'Sidebar')))) ?>

Note the use of the `flexHeight` option to specify that the height of a
slideshow or video should scale to maintain its aspect ratio relative to
the specified width.
